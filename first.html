    <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">Hello everyone. As 2022 is winding down to a close, let's reflect on the visual journey GENSHIN IMPACT artists have shared with the GENSHIN IMPACT community. This year we have shown a wider and deeper view of the GENSHIN IMPACT world than we have before to players. 

    You got to see GENSHIN IMPACT Agents hanging out on vacation with vibrant illustrations in the Lunar New Year event. We evolved our homepage’s scenes to show everyone elements of the storytelling or upcoming events in the GENSHIN IMPACT ecosystem. We shared new visual aesthetics for an Earth in an alternate dimension through new Maps and Cinematics with the launch of Pearl. Fade reveals that provide visual exploration of her nightmare with her cinematic reveal and illustrations. You were also able to refresh our User Interface designs in the live game…and that was only the start! Finally, some of our GENSHIN IMPACT artists had their first public presence at the Light Box event this year. The character concept team gave everyone a peek behind the curtain to share how they create the designs for our Agents. 
    <br><br>
    For next banner GENSHIN IMPACT , you will definitely see new Agents, maps, and premium content but a few other amazing visual surprises as well. Stick with us to see what’s coming next banner.</p>

    
    <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ; ">AUDIO</h3>
    <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">In 2022, we brought you our first talking gun skin and let you jump onboard the Genshin in the Sting audio logs. Fade made things nice and quiet so she can trigger your nightmares. Neon burst onto the scene with crackling energy and Harbor made a splash. We brought new music into the menus, maps, and the Champions skin. Also…there was the Neptune skinline! Thanks so much for playing and sharing your feedback with us this year. And hey, my favorite sound in the game is quality comms, so be good to each other in 2023!</a>
    
    
    <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ; ">CHARACTERS</h3>
    <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">Hey everyone, from all of us on the Character Team we just wanted to say a big thank you for playing this year. With Neon sprinting in, Fade tracking down enemies, and Harbor splitting up maps, it's been a wild 2022. ❤ We hope you all enjoy our lil agent doodles, and we are looking forward to shaking up 2023 with even more Agents.</a>

    <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">In 2022, the Competitive team introduced a new rank, shared a sneak peek of our "path to pro" team competition system called Premier, and made a number of improvements and additions to player behavior and matchmaking systems in order to create safer, fairer matches. 

        We have no plans to stop in 2023. Please continue to let us know what you want to see from us and share your ranked stories. Expect to see more updates about Premier (and an opportunity to play!!!) later in 2023.</a>
