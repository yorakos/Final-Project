    <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">Hello everyone. As 2022 is winding down to a close, let's reflect on the visual journey GENSHIN IMPACT artists have shared with the GENSHIN IMPACT community. This year we have shown a wider and deeper view of the GENSHIN IMPACT world than we have before to players. 

    You got to see GENSHIN IMPACT Agents hanging out on vacation with vibrant illustrations in the Lunar New Year event. We evolved our homepage’s scenes to show everyone elements of the storytelling or upcoming events in the GENSHIN IMPACT ecosystem. We shared new visual aesthetics for an Earth in an alternate dimension through new Maps and Cinematics with the launch of Pearl. Fade reveals that provide visual exploration of her nightmare with her cinematic reveal and illustrations. You were also able to refresh our User Interface designs in the live game…and that was only the start! Finally, some of our GENSHIN IMPACT artists had their first public presence at the Light Box event this year. The character concept team gave everyone a peek behind the curtain to share how they create the designs for our Agents. 
    <br><br>
    For next banner GENSHIN IMPACT , you will definitely see new Agents, maps, and premium content but a few other amazing visual surprises as well. Stick with us to see what’s coming next banner.</p>
