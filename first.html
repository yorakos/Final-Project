    <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">Hello everyone. As 2022 is winding down to a close, let's reflect on the visual journey GENSHIN IMPACT artists have shared with the GENSHIN IMPACT community. This year we have shown a wider and deeper view of the GENSHIN IMPACT world than we have before to players. 

    You got to see GENSHIN IMPACT Agents hanging out on vacation with vibrant illustrations in the Lunar New Year event. We evolved our homepage’s scenes to show everyone elements of the storytelling or upcoming events in the GENSHIN IMPACT ecosystem. We shared new visual aesthetics for an Earth in an alternate dimension through new Maps and Cinematics with the launch of Pearl. Fade reveals that provide visual exploration of her nightmare with her cinematic reveal and illustrations. You were also able to refresh our User Interface designs in the live game…and that was only the start! Finally, some of our GENSHIN IMPACT artists had their first public presence at the Light Box event this year. The character concept team gave everyone a peek behind the curtain to share how they create the designs for our Agents. 
    <br><br>
    For next banner GENSHIN IMPACT , you will definitely see new Agents, maps, and premium content but a few other amazing visual surprises as well. Stick with us to see what’s coming next banner.</p>

    
    <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ; ">AUDIO</h3>
    <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">In 2022, we brought you our first talking gun skin and let you jump onboard the Genshin in the Sting audio logs. Fade made things nice and quiet so she can trigger your nightmares. Neon burst onto the scene with crackling energy and Harbor made a splash. We brought new music into the menus, maps, and the Champions skin. Also…there was the Neptune skinline! Thanks so much for playing and sharing your feedback with us this year. And hey, my favorite sound in the game is quality comms, so be good to each other in 2023!</a>
    
    
    <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ; ">CHARACTERS</h3>
    <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">Hey everyone, from all of us on the Character Team we just wanted to say a big thank you for playing this year. With Neon sprinting in, Fade tracking down enemies, and Harbor splitting up maps, it's been a wild 2022. ❤ We hope you all enjoy our lil agent doodles, and we are looking forward to shaking up 2023 with even more Agents.</a>

    <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ; ">COMPETITIVE</h3>
    <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">In 2022, the Competitive team introduced a new rank, shared a sneak peek of our "path to pro" team competition system called Premier, and made a number of improvements and additions to player behavior and matchmaking systems in order to create safer, fairer matches. 

        We have no plans to stop in 2023. Please continue to let us know what you want to see from us and share your ranked stories. Expect to see more updates about Premier (and an opportunity to play!!!) later in 2023.</a>
    
        <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ; ">CREATIVE</h3>
        <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">Hey! Creative folk spend so much time living in the future (like we are already excited for all the things we are working on for next year), it’s a little nuts to pause for a minute and look back on all the things we delivered to players this year. 

            Brimstone really should consider putting a lock on the door of his office in The Range, but thx to his poor security protocol, we got to share a lot of snippets of Agents’ lives as well as letting players witness VALORANT battling a mysterious blackmailer before tracking her down, which led to the Fade launch video debut during VCT. 
            
              It felt really special to join so many players who tuned in to watch her debut as a new Agent.
            
            This was capped off with a major highlight for many of us—the opportunity to come to VCT in Istanbul and meet with players for the first time. It really is you who continues to inspire us in coming up with amazing stuff, so expect us to keep building out the VALORANT universe in 2023 with new Agents, maps and other cool stuff such as the [REDACTED].</a>

        <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ;">ESPORTS</h3>
        <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">Thank you to all the esports fans who supported us during the past year! Across Game Changers, Challengers, Masters, and Champions—the VALORANT Champions Tour continued to set new records and break down barriers all over the world. The energy and passion you brought to events large and small amplified every moment, creating our biggest season yet. 

            Throughout the year, the ideas you shared helped guide us as we sought to build a new model that would meet the growing demand we saw in every corner of the globe. Now, VCT ‘23 is right around the corner. Our esports teams have been busy planning for LOCK//IN, preparing our studios for the new International Leagues, and getting ready for an even bigger Champions. It’s gonna be awesome and we can’t wait to share it with you!</a>
        <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ;">INSIGHTS</h3>
        <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">We can’t believe it’s been another year and 2022 is coming to a close. Our team is continually hard at work making sure that VALORANT is fun to play for everyone by representing your voices through data. Insights' main purpose is to make sure everyone on our team knows what you think about our game and how changes impact you, whether that’s through our playtests and surveys or how the latest patch has affected the balance of our game (looking at you, Chamber).

            We’re always busy making sure that the game is fun for everyone, whether you’re just starting to learn or a seasoned pro, and if it’s not fun we help the team identify why. And for all the super secret stuff that we won’t spoil for you yet, we promise that players like yourselves get hands on early, so that you can tell us what you loved and what can be improved (a good example was our Premier Alpha in Brazil!). Thank you for playing our game! 
            
            P.S. If you ever get a survey from VALORANT and wonder if your responses get read, know that our team reads them. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.</a>

        <br> <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; ;">MAPS</h3>
        <br> <a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Candara;">A new map, several updates, map pools, esports activations, and live story… Thank you all for coming along the Maps ride this year. It was amazing seeing everyone’s reaction to Pearl and watching its play evolve over the last several months. We loved the new strategies you all came up with as maps and meta shifted. And we got to witness some incredible moments in VCT this year, #ziplines. We make the maps, but YOU make the stories. Hope you all had a great year in VAL and are looking forward to some Map surprises coming soon!</a>
